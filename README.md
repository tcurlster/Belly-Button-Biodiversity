# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Overview
The Belly Button Biodiversity dashboard displays bacteria samples taken from study participants to see what types of bacterias grow in their navels. The dashboard allows the user to select a specific test sample and see the top 10 types of bacterias found, the number of bacteria cultures found per sample and how often the subject cleans their navel per week along with the subject's demographic information.
